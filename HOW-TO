HOW TO:
1. The most simplest way to read the file is as follows.
	Crocus crocus = new Crocus(fileName, CSVConstants.TAB);
        CSVRecordManager manager = crocus.read();


2. Ok read it: now how to see what has been read.
	
       
    	for (int rowIndex = 0;rowIndex < manager.getRowCount();rowIndex++) {
            String temp = manager.getField(rowIndex, 4).toString();
    	}

for further information refer to the docs.
